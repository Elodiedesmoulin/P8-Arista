### Introduction

**Arista** is a health and wellness iOS app developed for the startup Arista.  
The project was built as part of the **OpenClassrooms iOS Developer Path (Project 8)**.  
It focuses on securely managing **local user data** using **CoreData**, while applying the **MVVM** pattern to keep the code clean, scalable, and testable.

---

### Features

- **User Data View** (pre-filled, read-only)
- **Sleep Data View** (pre-filled, read-only)
- **Exercise List View**:
  - Add a new exercise
  - Delete an existing exercise
- **All data persisted locally** using CoreData
- **Structured UI with navigation**
- **Improved UI/UX respecting mobile design best practices**

---

### Architecture

The app uses a clean **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** structure combined with **CoreData** for persistence:

#### View
SwiftUI views that handle user interaction and react to model updates.

#### ViewModel
Responsible for business logic, data formatting, and CoreData interactions (CRUD operations).

#### Model
Represents the CoreData entities: `User`, `Sleep`, `Exercise`. All conform to `NSManagedObject`.
